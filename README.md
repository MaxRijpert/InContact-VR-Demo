This is the VR demo I created for my Final Bachelor Project, in which I tested my proposed design for an external communication system for self-driving cars. The VR demo is a simple street environment with a crosswalk, in which a car (Tesla Model 3) approaches the crosswalk. The player/participant was tasked to cross the street when they felt it was safe enough to do so. 

The VR demo is setup so that the participant wears the VR headset, while the one conducting the test is holding the controllers in order to control various parts of the demo.

The buttons that control the demo are as follows:

Right controller:
- Primary Button: Car drives and stops before crosswalk
- Secondary Button: Car drives and does not stop before the crosswalk

Left Controller:
- Primary Button: Hide/unhide the external communication system on the car
- Secondary Button: Reset the position of the car to the start


NOTE: I made this project without prior experience in Unity, which means the code, filenames and structure can be very messy. There are probably also assets in the project that I ended up not using and have never removed. 

Since I'm done with my Final Bachelor Project, instead of this project collecting dust on my hard-drive, I wanted to at least share this project so it could perhaps be of some use to other people.
